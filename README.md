This is for final project collaboration for Alisson, Ann, Hung and Shiqiong 

Important notification for the grader.
After seeing instructor Cruz newest announcement. I am writting to instruct the way to correctly run our code.
1. after enter a name, you are able to run the personality quiz. followed by the result, as well as 14 png to show the user choice count in each questions with a bar graph.

Please delete all these 14 png in order to get the GUI pop up. (This is a bug we do not have enough time to solve it yet, will do this later)

Note, please run personality quiz! Please download the quizdata.csv in order to generate the graphs that colaborate with the GUI.

Your suggestions to our script will be highly appreciated!
