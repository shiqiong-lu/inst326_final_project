# Documentation
This is for final project collaboration for Alisson, Ann, Hung, and Shiqiong.
Our project is a personality quiz that will try to guess what the user is like.

Please run personality_quiz.py but first download quizdata.csv in order to later generate the graphs that collaborate with the GUI and background.png in order to run the script.

From the command line, access personality_quiz.py. After entering a name, you will be able to run the personality quiz and answer the questions. It will be followed by the result, as well as a png to show the user choice count in each question with a bar graph.
